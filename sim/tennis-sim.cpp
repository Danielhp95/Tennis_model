// idea:

// make a reliability metric, based on how well for *each* common opponent, 
// the one player appears better than the other

// incorporate omalley formula

// idea:

// build up a first service % profile in terms of mean and std dev
// from previous matches, then use 90th percentiles in best and worst
// performances

// idea:

// use fsp not from matches but from short term player stats. hence normalise performance against common opponents to remove variations in fsp?
